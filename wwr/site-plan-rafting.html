      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 02 - replace [Your purpose here] with your purpose in creating the website. This is NOT the reason for the assignment in the class. It is the reason the site owner would want to make this website -->
      <p>
        This website is dedicated to selling tools needed for rafting. While
        there are many stores specializing in rafting equipment, there are no
        any that sell them online. Therefore, I aim to create a
        consumer-friendly website offering a wide range of tools for enjoying
        rafting.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 02 - replace [Your audience here] with your audience. Who are they? What are their ages? What do they like to do? Why would they want to look at this website? You could even go as far as giving them names and bios-->
      <p>
        The primary customers of this website are men in their 20s to 40s. They
        are usually people who go rafting with friends or families looking to
        enjoy light rafting activities. These customers prefer to purchase
        rafting equipment online. In addition to rafting gear, they also want
        items that enhance the overall rafting experience. My website will
        primarily be accessed via laptops or desktops.
