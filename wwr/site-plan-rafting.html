      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 02 - replace [Your purpose here] with your purpose in creating the website. This is NOT the reason for the assignment in the class. It is the reason the site owner would want to make this website -->
      <p>
        My purpose is to introduce Korean comics. Korea has many interesting
        comics, and a significant number of them are being translated into
        English. Japanese comics are very popular, and there are numerous
        websites and resources introduced to them. However, Korean comics are
        still in the early stages of gaining recognition, so there are not many
        websites or resources that provide information about them. For this
        reason, I decided to create a website to introduce Korean comics and
        related information.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <!-- TODO: Week 02 - replace [Your audience here] with your audience. Who are they? What are their ages? What do they like to do? Why would they want to look at this website? You could even go as far as giving them names and bios-->
      <p>
        The target customer is teenagers and young adults, both male and female.
        They are looking for interesting comics and are recently interested in
        K-pop, which has sparked their curiosity about Korean comics as well.
        They have enough allowance to pay for and enjoy comics. While they want
        to know about Korean comics, they struggle to find a well-organized
        website that satisfies their needs. They want to know about the genres,
        popularity, content, and prices of Korean comics. My audience will
        primarily access my website through mobile devices or laptops.
